Naruto Uzumaki and Sakura Haruno, however, feel differently. Naruto is jealous of his comrades' congratulatory families, wishing for the presence of his own parents. Sakura, on the other hand, is angry at her embarrassing parents, and wishes for no parents at all. The two clash over their opposing ideals, but are faced with a more pressing matter when the masked Madara Uchiha suddenly appears and transports them to an alternate world.\n\nIn this world, Sakura's parents are considered heroes—for they gave their lives to protect Konohagakure from the Nine-Tailed Fox attack 10 years ago. Consequently, Naruto's parents, Minato Namikaze and Kushina Uzumaki, are alive and well. Unable to return home or find the masked Madara, Naruto and Sakura stay in this new world and enjoy the changes they have always longed for. All seems well for the two ninja, until an unexpected threat emerges that pushes Naruto and Sakura to not only fight for the Konohagakure of the alternate world, but also to find a way back to their own.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","thumb":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/r/50x70/images/anime/1620/94336.webp?s=23bc5d0b23870f5bc1227cfaa008a94f","type":"Movie"},{"_id":"6154","title":"Saint Seiya: Meiou Hades Juuni Kyuu-hen - Yomigaerishi Gold Saint-tachi no Shinwa","alternativeTitles":["冥王ハーデス十二宮編　よみがえりし黄金聖闘士たちの神話","Saint Seiya: The Hades Chapter - Recaps"],"ranking":1220,"genres":["Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"episodes":2,"hasEpisode":true,"hasRanking":true,"image":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/13518.webp","link":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/6154/Saint_Seiya__Meiou_Hades_Juuni_Kyuu-hen_-_Yomigaerishi_Gold_Saint-tachi_no_Shinwa","status":"Finished Airing","synopsis":"Is a summary of the Saga Hades Sanctuary from the perspective of the golden knights resurrected, especially Shura, Camus and Saga.","thumb":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/r/50x70/images/anime/7/13518.webp?s=21aa44d3cd06219e18faee1d08588fd9","type":"Special"},{"_id":"30311","title":"Kuroko no Basket 3rd Season NG-shuu","alternativeTitles":["黒子のバスケ3期 NG集"],"ranking":1221,"genres":["Comedy","Sports"],"episodes":9,"hasEpisode":true,"hasRanking":true,"image":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/72551.webp","link":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/30311/Kuroko_no_Basket_3rd_Season_NG-shuu","status":"Finished Airing","synopsis":"Animated bloopers included with the Blu-ray/DVD releases of the Kuroko no Basket 3rd Season.","thumb":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/r/50x70/images/anime/13/72551.webp?s=ab0e7b69a09b734debd0c9a6a768edc4","type":"Special"},{"_id":"4454","title":"Macross F: Close Encounter - Deculture Edition","alternativeTitles":["Macross Frontier: Close Encounter - Deculture Edition","マクロスＦ　第1話「クロース・エンカウンター」Deculture edition"],"ranking":1222,"genres":["Action","Sci-Fi"],"episodes":1,"hasEpisode":true,"hasRanking":true,"image":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/8507.webp","link":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/4454/Macross_F__Close_Encounter_-_Deculture_Edition","status":"Finished Airing","synopsis":"An expanded version of the first episode of Macross Frontier.","thumb":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/r/50x70/images/anime/4/8507.webp?s=fbffd47487c1cd40519c7b95c241de41","type":"Special"},{"_id":"323","title":"Mousou Dairinin","alternativeTitles":["Mousou Dairinin","妄想代理人","Paranoia Agent","Paranoja Agent","Paranoia Agent","Paranoia Agent"],"ranking":1223,"genres":["Avant Garde","Drama","Mystery","Supernatural","Suspense"],"episodes":13,"hasEpisode":true,"hasRanking":true,"image":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/10240.webp","link":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/323/Mousou_Dairinin","status":"Finished Airing","synopsis":"The infamous Shounen Bat (Lil' Slugger) is terrorizing the residents of Musashino City.
